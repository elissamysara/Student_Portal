#  Student Portal Management System (Green Theme)

A professional and minimal student portal system developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a clean "Green Theme" UI designed for a calm and focused user experience.

##  Project File Structure
The project is organized into the following main files:
* **`index 2.html`**: The primary login page featuring a centered authentication card.
* **`dashboard.html`**: The main overview page containing statistical cards and registration analytics.
* **`profile.html`**: A dedicated page for displaying personal student information and point tracking.
* **`course.html`**: A module for managing and viewing enrolled student courses.
* **`results.html`**: A page for reviewing academic performance and examination results.
* **`schedule.html`**: A section for students to view their class timetables and exam schedules.

##  Access Credentials
The portal uses the following hardcoded credentials for login authentication:
* **Matric Number**: `2020888`
* **Password**: `coolurvee`

##  Key Features
* **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays a 6-month student registration trend using a bar chart powered by **Chart.js**.
* **Data Summary Cards**: Provides quick views of Total Students (380), New Registered (100), Active Users (250), and Inactive students (30).
* **Persistent Sidebar**: A fixed navigation menu on the left side with icons for seamless switching between pages.
* **Notice Board**: A dedicated section for important announcements like maintenance alerts and registration deadlines.
* **Secure Logout**: A confirmation-based logout function that clears session data from `localStorage` and redirects to `index 2.html`.

##  Technology Stack
* **Frontend**: HTML5 and CSS3 (utilizing Bootstrap 5.3) for a structured and responsive layout.
* **Scripting**: JavaScript (ES6) for authentication logic, session management, and UI interactivity.
* **Visualization**: **Chart.js** library for rendering dynamic data graphs.
